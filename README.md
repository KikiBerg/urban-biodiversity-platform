Welcome to **Urban Biodiversity Platform** a blog dedicated to fostering a community passionate about urban ecology and biodiversity. Our mission is to raise awareness, spark conversations, and promote collaboration around the importance of preserving and enhancing the rich biodiversity in our urban environments.

## UX
The theme of the project is urban biodiversity, so I wanted to use a color palette that gives an eco-friendly and sustainable vibe.

### Colour Scheme
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

I've also used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme.

```css
:root{

    /*Colours*/
    --color-primary: #535832;
    --color-secondary: #95A968;
    --color-accent: #f0c965;
    --color-text: #444;
    --color-background: #e4e4e4;
    --color-background-main: #fefeff;    
    --color-bark: #795548;
    --color-sky: #4eb8d8;
    --color-btn-primary: #1587aa;
    --color-earth: #8D6E63;
    --color-delete: #d9534f;
    --color-white: #ffffff;
    --color-grey: #bbbbbb;
```

### Typography
I used [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) for all text in various font-sizes and weights. 
Reasons why I chose Merriweather:
- I find that Merriweather's readability and elegance ensures that the content is easy to digest, which is crucial for longer articles like the ones on this project.

## User Stories
I created the user stories in the beginning of the project so that I could better organize the structure of the site. 
Some of the stories were adjusted during the working process, so as to better fit my final ideas.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects
[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/KikiBerg/urban-biodiversity-platform/projects?query=is%3Aopen) was used as an Agile tool for this project.
There are probaply more ideal tools out there, but for now it served its purpose.
I used this tool for planning my user stories & issues, then followed up now and then using the Kanban board.

### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KikiBerg/urban-biodiversity-platform/issues) was also used as an Agile tool.
I created my own **User Story Template** in order to manage the user stories.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/KikiBerg/urban-biodiversity-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
I placed these to a **Backlog** column as they are features that were not prioritized and are seen as possible future implementations.

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/KikiBerg/urban-biodiversity-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+) 

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've prioritized my user stories using this method and used labels for my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered 
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital 
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out 
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration
